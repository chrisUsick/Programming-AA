Informal Report and Presentation Assignment
This assignment consists of two major components, creating an informational report and presenting that report in front of the class. The assignment is marked out of 40. The report is worth 30 marks, the presentation is 10 marks. In order to receive a mark for this assignment both components must be completed (you will not receive part marks for completing the report but not doing the presentation and vice-versa).

## Informational Report:
The informational report can be based on any topic you like, whether IT related or not. The student will research information on their chosen topic and write a report that provides more indepth knowledge on that topic. Before beginning the assignment, you must receive approval for the topic from your instructor. E-mail your instructor with the topic title plus a single paragraph indicating what you would like to report on. Topics are accepted on a first-come first-serve basis. Your instructor will begin accepting topic requests upon receipt of this assignment. DO NOT assume your topic has been accepted until you receive a response from your instructor indicating that it has been. Two students cannot present on the same topic, so you may be required to choose an alternate topic if someone has already picked the topic you want to do. Also, if your instructor considers the topic to be too broad you may be asked to narrow down the scope.

The report must be formatted as follows:
Standard 8.5*11 white paper
1” margin on all sides
All text in either New Times Roman or Arial font
Font size 11
Double spaced lines
At least one diagram or one table must be used
Minimum of 3 pages of contents
Maximum of 6 pages of contents
At least 5 references to information sources cited in APA format
The report must contain the following:
Cover Page*
Table of Contents*
Table of figures and/or table of tables*
Introduction
Body
Conclusion
Reference List*

Note: The items marked ‘*’ do not count towards the 3-6 page content limits.

## Presentation
All students will present their informational report to the remainder of the class after midterm week of the course. Preferred presentation time is to be reserved by the student. Contact your instructor by email starting on the Monday before midterm week (early requests will be ignored) to book your preferred presentation time. DO NOT assume your presentation time request has been accepted until you receive a reply from your instructor indicating that it has been. All presentation times must be booked by the end of that week or will be assigned by the instructor. Present the contents of your informational report to your classmates. Do not simply read the informational report aloud. Put together some sort of visual presentation (use your imagination) to present your information. Each presentation must:
- Use some sort of visual aid(s)
- Last from 3-5 minutes
- Allow 1-2 minutes for questions at the end
